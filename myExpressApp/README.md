**Notes To Keep In Mind**

* The `package.json` file is the main file that contains all the dependencies and scripts for the project.
* The `node_modules` folder contains all the dependencies for the project.
* Use code . to open the folder of the project in VSC. This is what you will deploy onto azure
* All content is stored in the index.js file
* MongoDB is set to allow any IP Address to use it in the security settings. Good practice to change this later
